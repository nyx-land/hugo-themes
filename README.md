Here are a couple themes I've made over the years for the Hugo static
site generator. I no longer use it myself, but someone might find this
"code" (HTML templates) useful, so I'm posting them here. This code is
very old and bad and probably doesn't even work anymore so I'm not
putting in any effort into attempting to document this stuff or check
that it still works. Good luck!
